# Testing class Guidelines
> Test class and method name should be the same as the actual class or method name appended with `Test` at last.
> Use `@Mock` annotation to mock a stand alone class when it does not have any dependant mock object.
> Use `@InjectMocks` annotation to mock a stand alone class when it has a dependant mock object.
